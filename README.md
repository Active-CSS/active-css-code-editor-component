An Active CSS code editor component for playing with Active CSS, HTML and CSS.

Requires at least Active CSS version 2.4.0.

It consists of two files, an Active CSS config file and a CSS that is loaded internally. It can be included multiple times on a single page, and the component's HTML tag needs at least 340px in width. The code editor will work on any device size as long as it has at least 340px width allocated to it. Its CSS is based on its own width - not the device's width. This is down to Active CSS's ability to add a class to an element inside a shadow DOM component according to any HTML element's natural width after a window resize event.

Instructions will follow shortly.
